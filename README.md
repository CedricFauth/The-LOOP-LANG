# The-LOOP-LANG
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOP_(programming_language)

An attempt to build an interpreter for the theoretical LOOP language.

### Default grammar of loop:

```
P := Xi := Xj + c
   | Xi := Xj - c
   | P;P
   | "LOOP" Xi "DO" P "END"

(where i,j are natural numbers)
```

### Features of the interpreter:
The interpreter has some features which may simplify programs:
 - Arbitrary long expressions when assigning variables like: X4 := X3 - 2 + A42 + 123 + 314159
 - The interpreter supports variable names starting with a capital letter followed by 1 to 2 digits e.g.: X12, A2, G34, ...
 - Not allowed are names like: X, R342, HE, %ยง&,  ...
 - as in the original language, programs need to be seperated by a semicolon
 - all variables are initialized to 0 by default
 - output variable is always X0
 - values of input variables (starting with X1, X2, ...) need to be specified by the input parameter: -in=VALUE1,VALUE2,...
 - LOOP statements can handle expressions as condition like: LOOP 4 + X1 DO ...


### Internal grammar of this interpreter
```
program   -> statement ( ";" statement )* ;

statement -> loop
             | assign ;

loop    -> "LOOP" var "DO" program "END" ;
assign  -> var ":=" expr ;

expr    -> add ;
add     -> primary ( ("+"|"-") primary )* ;
primary -> var | number ;

var     -> {A,...,Z} x {0,...,99} ;
number -> {0,...} ;
